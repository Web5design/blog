# Informatics blog howto

We're using the blog deploying strategy referred to as ["With Github Project pages (gh-pages)"](http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/github/)

## Getting started

In order to publish to Informatics UNEP-WCMC blog, please start by cloning this directory:

    git clone git@github.com:unepwcmc/blog-src.git


__Now there must be a simpler way to go from there, but while I haven't found out please follow these steps:__ 

Next, you need to configure octopress so that it knows to deploy the blog to the 'blog' repo gh-pages branch:

    cd blog-src
    rake setup_github_pages

When asked for a repository url, enter: git@github.com:unepwcmc/blog.git

Now this might have the side effect of changing the blog url in _config.tml file -- please open that file and make sure it has:

    url: http://informatics.unep-wcmc.org/blog

## Writing a new post

    rake new_post["my great new post"]

This command will create the file for you and place it in the octopress date-driven directory structure. You can then edit this file using plain html / markdown.

## Previewing

    rake preview

This starts a local server, you can preview the blog at localhost:4000/blog

## Publishing vs pushing

After any changes to the blog you can publish them to the 'blog' repo using:

    rake generate
    rake deploy

However, that does not push to 'blog-src', you need to do that manually:

    cd blog-src
    git add .
    git commit -m "my commit msg"
    git push origin source
