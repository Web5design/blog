  <div class="entry-content"><p>This summer at WCMC we are privileged to be working with two teams of amazing ladies. They are sharpening their programming skills while helping open source projects as part of their <a href="http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/">RG Summer of Code internships</a>. Meet our teams!</p>

<p style="clear:both">
<img class="left" src="/blog/images/summer_of_code/team_species_plus.gif" width="300" title="Team Species+" >

<strong>Team Species+:</strong> Wiktoria Dalach and Alicja Cyganiewicz are making their way through the perplexities of taxonomy. They are all set to make species information understandable through smart visualisations powered by the upcoming Species+ API. <a href="http://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/teams/7">Team page</a>

<img class="right" src="/blog/images/summer_of_code/team_protected_planet.jpg" width="350" title="Team ProtectedPlanet" >

<strong>Team ProtectedPlanet:</strong> Patricia Cupueran and Paola Moreno are a volunteer RG SoC team of astonishing spirit and perseverance. They are working on integrating data from the <a href="http://www.protectedplanet.net/">ProtectedPlanet</a> API into a tourism site revolving around exploring protected areas.
</p>




<p>
We wanted to discover what drives them and how they are finding their Summer of Code so far. Quite interestingly, it turns out <strong>C/C++</strong> still has a lot of appeal for brilliant young minds and that the world of software is one of <strong>enjoyable suffering</strong>. This is what they&#8217;ve told us:
</p>




<h2>What is the single most amusing / unexpected / crazy thing you learned in the last three weeks?</h2>




<p>
<strong>Patricia:</strong>
Building up fast web applications using Ruby on Rails, updating databases and retrieving some information. Learn how URL works to manage the control of API&#8217;s
</p>


<p>
<strong>Paola:</strong>
You don’t only learn ruby and rails (which are powerful by themselves), you learn a style of programming called excellent practices instead of good practices. You become able to develop in team, produce good blocks of code, take account of the time and minimize the times you could screw up!
</p>


<p>
<strong>Wiktoria:</strong>
I learned that I can solve some problems just by reading error messages :D
</p>


<p>
<strong>Alicja:</strong>
That I don&#8217;t have to reinvent the wheel, the Internet ;) There are so many frameworks, gems, libraries&#8230; It was a little bit frightening (oh my God, I know next to nothing about being a software developer!), really amazing, though. It&#8217;s like santa&#8217;s sack - bottomless, infinite.
</p>

<h2>What is the best thing about being a software developer?</h2>


<p>
<strong>Patricia:</strong>
Designing solutions to solve software problems. Working in a group, coming up with new ideas.
</p>


<p>
<strong>Paola:</strong>
That you can do anything! Being a programmer is like having a magic wand. With software you can venture into any field, turn any idea into something tangible, help to speed up many processes, etc. And on a personal level, it gives you an interesting twist hahaha!
</p>


<p>
<strong>Wiktoria:</strong>
The best thing about being a software dev is a possibility to create something from almost nothing. Something that can be pretty, useful for others and can help them.
</p>


<p>
<strong>Alicja:</strong>
It&#8217;s creating stuff. Making things &#8220;happen&#8221;. Facing the challenges. That feeling when you can stay awake for the whole night, focused on a goal.
</p>

</tbody></table>




<h2>How did you first become interested in programming?</h2>


<p>
<strong>Patricia:</strong>
When I was at university, I learnt to program in C.
</p>


<p>
<strong>Paola:</strong>
I had a great teacher who simply taught me to admire, learn programming, and also to survive on the way!
</p>


<p>
<strong>Wiktoria:</strong>
Well.. :) Long story short. I&#8217;ve never been interested in programming, but all of a sudden I&#8217;ve discovered, that it can be fun and influential. I took part in the first Polish Rails Girls edition in 2012 and 12 months later I was a RG coach for the first time.
</p>


<p>
<strong>Alicja:</strong>
Being deeply in love with Math I chose Mathematics and Information Technologies at High School. We were learning C++. And I could stay in the classroom for ever. Making things &#8220;happen&#8221; was an extremely amazing feeling.
</p>

<h2>Best piece of advice you were given so far in your coding career?</h2>


<p>
<strong>Patricia:</strong>
Before implementing code, make drawings (schemes, models, window interfaces&#8230;) to have a clearer idea of what is aimed to be developed. Making the coding organized, and work using modularity when possible to facilitate maintenance and reuse of code.
</p>


<p>
<strong>Paola:</strong>
Reuse, do it functional and understandable for users, and when something doesn’t work, have a break with a coffee (or beer), relax and then sit down to see if you found the solution!
</p>


<p>
<strong>Wiktoria:</strong>
Think about programming language as just another foreign language to learn. Accept the rules and keep writing and reading. We don&#8217;t expect German not to have &#8220;der die das&#8221; or English to be written as pronounced, right? So it should be with a programming language - you learn it just to tell a different kind of a story :)
</p>


<p>
<strong>Alicja:</strong>
There are no stupid questions - my friend who works with me says it every single day. So feel free to ask, to look for. Google is not going to make fun of you.
</p>

<tr><td class="caption" style="padding:1em;font-style:italic">Patricia gets the &#8220;Rocky Balboa&#8221; badge for adoption of modular design and solid foundations in C.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>




<h2>What would you say to other women interested in getting into software development?</h2>


<p>
<strong>Patricia:</strong>
Start learning the basics of any programming language and then choose a programming language to learn more, regarding what application you would like to work on. And even if it is a bit hard at the beginning, later on it will make you feel happy with yourself since you get results of your work that really encourage to learn more about software developement.
</p>


<p>
<strong>Paola:</strong>
Do not think twice! This is a fascinating world where people suffer, but enjoy! ;)
</p>


<p>
<strong>Wiktoria:</strong>
Go for it! There is nothing to be worried about.
</p>


<p>
<strong>Alicja:</strong>
If I can do it - you can do it as well. Your sex has no connection with dev-stuff. Sorry, wrong. There is a connection. We can be better, but shhhh&#8230; ;)

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Note</strong>: the following article assumes the reader has at least some basic knowledge of <strong>d3</strong>. If one has never used <strong>d3</strong> before I would suggest reading the <a href="http://d3js.org/">introduction</a> on the library homepage and <a href="http://bost.ocks.org/mike/join/">Thinking with Joins</a> before continuing the read.</p>

<p>I have recently been working at a <a href="http://wcmc.io/map">simple visualization</a>, where some circles, generated in <strong>d3</strong> and representing ip addresses, are layered out on <strong>Google Maps</strong>. It turned out that using <strong>d3</strong> made it surprisingly clean and easy, to handle the user-driven visualization changes. Surprisingly because, as others, I somehow struggled to fully understand and correctly use <strong>d3</strong>.</p>

<p>To give an idea about how <strong>d3</strong> can be misused, here is an excerpt from some <a href="https://github.com/deciob/data-story/blob/master/app/controllers/viz/bar_base.coffee">old code</a> of mine:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/5808864.js?file=writings-1-a.coffee'></script>
<noscript><pre><code># first check if there is no histogram around...
if @g.selectAll('path')[0].length == 0
  @bar = @g.selectAll(&quot;g.bar&quot;)
    .data(data)
    .enter().append(&quot;g&quot;)
  @bar.append(&quot;rect&quot;)
#
# ...more code...
#
else
  @g.selectAll(&quot;rect&quot;)
    .data(data)
    .transition()</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>Although this code works, inserting a <code>selectAll</code> into an if statement, to check if the selection is empty, is nasty and bad stuff! But thinking about <code>selectAll</code> as a placeholder for my data is something that took some time for me to feel comfortable with.</p>

<p>These days, after some struggles and experiences, I think that writing simple <strong>Data Driven Documents</strong> with <strong>d3</strong>, once one manages to grab a few fundamental concepts such as the <strong>enter-update-exit</strong> pattern, can become surprisingly easy. And hopefully, the following walk-trough will help others to understand.</p>

<h3>The architecture basics.</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://wcmc.io/map">page</a> in question is a <strong>backbone.js</strong> application that is part of a larger <strong>rails</strong> website, but can easily be analyzed in isolation. The starting point for this code was the following <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/899711">block</a>.</p>

<p>It has two views, one for the map and one for listing the ip location details that relate to the circles on the map.</p>

<p>The data rendered on <strong>Google Maps</strong> is clustered on 3 levels, depending on the zoom: country, city and individual locations. The user can click on the circles (the data) and these are re-drawn as active, whilst a list of information appears on the bottom view.</p>

<p>Frankly, a quite simple application, with not much interaction. Nevertheless, even the most innocent and naive <strong>JavaScript</strong> Web application, we all know, can easily grow into an inextricable mess. <strong>Backbone</strong> here helps, but the <strong>update-data&#8211;update-view</strong> pattern doesn&#8217;t always fit well with a <strong>Google Maps</strong> data representation. It is here that <strong>d3</strong> enters the stage and helps, with its <strong>enter-update-exit data</strong> pattern, to keep things surprisingly simple.</p>

<h3>How the data is structured and handled.</h3>

<p>For every cluster level we have a <strong>backbone</strong> model-collection and all of them inherit a number of methods from the base-class <a href="https://github.com/unepwcmc/wukumurl/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/map/models/base.js.coffee">base.js.coffee</a>. The most important of these is <code>parseDataForMap</code>, that returns the current collection data in the form expected by <strong>d3</strong>&#8217;s <code>selection.data</code> method in <a href="https://github.com/unepwcmc/wukumurl/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/map/views/map_view.js.coffee">map_view.js.coffee</a>.</p>

<p>For clarity, this is an example of an object in the array returned from <code>parseDataForMap</code> on the countries collection:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/5808864.js?file=writings-1-b.json'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>[
  {
    &quot;lat&quot;:35.8706911472,
    &quot;lng&quot;:104.1904317352,
    &quot;state&quot;:&quot;inactive&quot;,
    &quot;size&quot;:2,
    &quot;id&quot;:122,
    &quot;uique_id&quot;:262.0611228824
  },
]</code></pre></noscript></div>


<h3>The application flow.</h3>

<p>Almost all the code related to <strong>d3</strong> and <strong>Google Maps</strong> lives in <a href="https://github.com/unepwcmc/wukumurl/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/map/views/map_view.js.coffee">map_view.js.coffee</a>. Here, two key functions occupy the scene: <code>initOverlays</code> and <code>drawSvg</code>.</p>

<p><strong>initOverlays</strong></p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/5808864.js?file=writings-1-c.coffee'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>initOverlays: -&gt;
  self = this
  # Remove loading gif
  $(&quot;.ajax-loader&quot;).hide()
  @data = @collection.parseDataForMap()
  @max = @collection.getMaxVal()
  # Create an overlay.
  overlay = new google.maps.OverlayView()

  # Add the container when the overlay is added to the map.
  overlay.onAdd = -&gt;
    layer = d3.select(@getPanes().overlayMouseTarget)
      .append(&quot;div&quot;).attr(&quot;class&quot;, &quot;locations&quot;)
    self.drawSvg = _.bind self.drawSvg, @, layer, self

  overlay.draw = -&gt;
    self.drawSvg self.data

  # Bind our overlay to the map…
  overlay.setMap @map</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p><code>initOverlays</code> sets up the initial <strong>Google Maps</strong> configuration and initial overlay (the <strong>SVG</strong> circles related to the country clusters). The nested methods here refer to the <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/">Google Maps JavaScript API</a>. It is worth noticing:</p>

<ol>
<li>In <code>overlay.onAdd</code> we are setting a <strong>d3</strong> selection in the map, for our <strong>SVG</strong> elements, and we are then partially applying the <code>drawSvg</code> method with it, because this initial selection never changes across the entire life of the application.</li>
<li>Once the map is set (after calling <code>overlay.setMap</code>) <code>drawSvg</code> is called with the initial data. At this point the <strong>SVG</strong> circles, representing the ip locations clustered on the country centroids, will appear on the map.</li>
</ol>


<p><strong>drawSvg</strong></p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/5808864.js?file=writings-1-d.coffee'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>drawSvg: (layer, self, data) -&gt;
  #
  # ... more code...
  #
  marker = layer.selectAll(&quot;svg&quot;)
    .data(data, (d) -&gt; d.uique_id)
    .each(transform) # update existing markers
    .attr(&quot;class&quot;, (d) -&gt; d.state)

  enter = marker.enter().append(&quot;svg:svg&quot;)
    .each(transform)
    .attr(&quot;class&quot;, (d) -&gt; d.state)

  # Lets position the text first (under the circle), 
  # so it does not interfere with the click events. 
  # Only works because our circles are semi-transparent.
  txt = enter.append(&quot;svg:text&quot;)
    .each(transformTxt)
    .attr(&quot;dy&quot;, &quot;.31em&quot;)
    .text((d) -&gt; d.size)
    .style(&quot;font-size&quot;, (d) -&gt; 
      s = self.getFontSize d.size
      &quot;#{s}px&quot;
    )

  circle = enter.append(&quot;svg:circle&quot;)
    .each(addEventListeners)
    .each(transformCircle)

  exit = marker.exit()
    #.each(removeEventListener) # TODO?
    .remove()</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>And finally we get to analyze the <code>drawSvg</code> method, that hopefully will shed some light on how <strong>d3</strong>&#8217;s <strong>enter-update-exit</strong> pattern works. Let&#8217;s walk through it across three different states of our application.</p>

<h4>1. We start from the initial data load state.</h4>

<ul>
<li><code>marker = layer.selectAll("svg")</code> selects all the <strong>SVG</strong> elements within our layer element (the div we have created earlier, in the <code>initOverlays</code> method, remember?). The first time this is called, the selection will be empty, just a placeholder for future elements.</li>
<li><code>.data(data, (d) -&gt; d.uique_id)</code> is the data join. Note how I am passing a key function as the second argument. Not passing this key value, that uniquely identifies each object, would insert a bug in the code when changing levels (country-city-locations). The data objects entering or exiting the selection would be compared by array index, rather than object id and would no longer be distinguishable.</li>
<li><code>.each(transform)</code> is used to correctly set the elements on <strong>Google Maps</strong>. It is called before and after the <code>enter</code> point because of how <strong>Google Maps</strong> works: on every zoom change <code>overlay.draw</code> will be called and everything will need updating again.</li>
<li><code>enter = marker.enter().append("svg:svg")</code> is the entry point where our new <strong>SVG</strong>s are appended to the DOM. On the first call all the data is new and entering. The function then continues appending text (numbers indicating the size of the data) and circle elements to our recently created <strong>SVG</strong> elements.</li>
<li><code>exit = marker.exit().remove()</code> finally cleans up the old data. On the first load though, all data is new and nothing is in exit.</li>
</ul>


<h4>2. So what happens when we pass from zoom level 5 to 6 and our data is now clustered around cities and no longer around country centroids?</h4>

<ul>
<li><code>marker = layer.selectAll("svg")</code> is now no longer empty.</li>
<li><code>.data(data, (d) -&gt; d.uique_id)</code>, here new data is coming into the selection, with new unique_ids, all different from the existing ids (the country cluster objects).</li>
<li><code>enter = marker.enter().append("svg:svg")</code>, the incoming data is all new, so we have an entry point for every object in the data array.</li>
<li><code>exit = marker.exit().remove()</code>, the exit is full, all the old, existing data is now old, because the object ids no longer match, so they are all removed.</li>
</ul>


<h4>3. But what about the <code>update</code> portion of the pattern? Are we using it here at all? Yes we are. The data gets updated when the user selects, with a click, an <strong>SVG</strong> circle on the map.</h4>

<ul>
<li><code>marker = layer.selectAll("svg")</code>, again, this selection is not empty.</li>
<li><code>.data(data, (d) -&gt; d.uique_id)</code>, new data is coming in, but in this case, none of the object ids have changed!</li>
<li><code>enter = marker.enter().append("svg:svg")</code>, so no new data is appended.</li>
<li><code>exit = marker.exit().remove()</code>: and no old data is removed. But&#8230;</li>
<li><code>.attr("class", (d) -&gt; d.state)</code>, the state attribute will be updated, only for the selected <strong>SVG</strong>.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>The pattern here is quite clear. The <strong>SVG</strong> circles are drawn. The user interacts with the map, zooming in and out and clicking on the <strong>SVG</strong> elements. These events will fire the appropriate application events and the <code>drawSvg</code> function is repeatedly called with different, updated data. We are not interested on what kind of event originated the call and in what changes are happening to the data. We can always happily and blindly call <code>drawSvg</code> and the enter-update-exit points in the code will correctly handle all the rest for us.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>How can scientists make their complicated domain relevant to policy? </h2>


<p>This was the main issue discussed at my recent visit to Oxford University for a scientific data visualisation workshop.</p>

<blockquote><p>“The matter with human beans,&#8221; the BFG went on, &#8220;is that they is absolutely refusing to believe in anything unless they is actually seeing it right in front of their own schnozzles.” <br/>― Roald Dahl, The BFG</p></blockquote>


<p>It was a day of short presentations from researchers in the field of <a href='http://www.itrc.org.uk/'>modelling the future of national infrastructure</a> followed by insights from people in the field of data visualisations.  I shared the experiences of UNEP-WCMC in striving to produce visualisations on the web that have real influence and genuinely impact &#8220;decision makers&#8221;.</p>

<p>My presentation focussed on three main points:</p>

<p><li>So obvious but so often ignored.  To be able to communicate science to policy makers it needs to solve a genuine problem of a user, e.g. how do we make it easier for a senior civil servant to understand the value of biodiversity, how can an environmental minister have information that gives them power when debating with the finance minister, how can civil society be empowered to apply pressure to their governments?  Scientific discovery often isn&#8217;t a response to an immediate political problem so aligning the discovery with a policy demand can be difficult.</li></p>

<p><li>The process of designing visualisations can follow a bunch of important principles which help everything from usability to the aesthetics of a clear message.  A clear message that fulfils the objectives of a user.  However, when we create something it&#8217;s subject to all the assumptions and bias of any human bean, therefore it&#8217;s critical to test our principles for success.  The Internet is a great playground for testing and improvement so I talked a little about how we are doing usability and A/B testing to inform whether we are any good or not.</li></p>

<p><li>I couldn&#8217;t help but talk about some of the software we use to do our jobs, why SQL is so good, and Ruby is a great language for tooling around with data and making websites.  I also introduced some of the open source software we are developing to convert complex analytic science into simple mapping exploration interfaces.</li></p>

<p>Here is the presentation I gave:</p>

<h3>Some overall reflections.</h3>




<p>It struck me that the data visualisation movement can appear to be more art than science, it&#8217;s why scientists are struggling with it.  I think there is scope to be more scientific and optimise our design based on empirical data however I also think we need to encourage art back into the science domain where usability and information design are the obvious cross-over.  I&#8217;m excited to see this cross over already happening.</p>




<p>A great conversation emerged with Greg McInerny (one such cross-over scientist:  <a href='https://twitter.com/GregMcI'>@GregMcI</a>) where we explored the idea of scaling up usability tests on data visualisations, harnessing communities such as those in the Oxford Astrophysics lab Galaxy Zoo project.  The idea would be to see if we can optimise the impact of visualisations by adjusting one parameter at a time and asking questions to users about the information (e.g. gradually increase saturation of colour or location of title or legend font or increase number of parameters displayed).  If this process could be automated, one could in theory feed in a visualisation on day 1 and on day 4 we would have an altered visualisation optimised to deliver the greatest impact.  An embryo of an idea with many many things to consider but if nothing else it would be great to test the principles of design we hold so dear.</p>


<p>Well worth the 4am start, my head hurts from talking with so many smart people.  My resolve to try and figure out how to improve the impact of environmental science in the policy world has been strengthened.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Field testing in Abu Dhabi</h2>


<p><img class="left" src="/blog/images/field_testing_abu_dhabi/the_app.png" width="300" title="The Blue Carbon iPad App" ></p>

<p>UNEP-WCMC Informatics recently built their first in-house mobile application integrated with the AGEDI Blue Carbon 12 month Demonstration project to map the blue carbon habitats of Abu Dhabi.</p>




<p>The iOS application enables field scientists and volunteers to collect data on the location, size and characteristics of Mangroves, Seagrass, Salt Marsh and Algal Mat from the field regardless of there being a data connection.</p>




<p>The application was built with HTML, CSS and Javascript through <a href="http://phonegap.com/">phonegap</a> and syncronises to CartoDB, a geospacially enabled PostreSQL database, feeding the main browser based blue carbon application.</p>




<p>Throughout the development phase we tested the application, validating substitute habitats around Cambridge, and user tested with members of the field scientist team before they left for Abu Dhabi.</p>




<p>There is of course no substitute however for putting yourself in the end users shoes and actually using the application in the intended environment for an extended period of time.</p>




<p>In May of this year I had the opportunity to do just that, and took the iPad through its paces in Abu Dhabi mapping a number of areas of Mangrove east of the main city.</p>




<p>The application had been used by the field teams in late January / February and they’d done a great job of carefully logging all issues/errors they encountered, the scenarios under which they occurred, date, time and even climatic conditions.</p>


<p><img class="left" src="/blog/images/field_testing_abu_dhabi/waterproof_case.png" width="250" title="The iPad in its waterproof Over Board case" >
<img class="left" src="/blog/images/field_testing_abu_dhabi/using_the_app_for_navigation.png" width="250" title="Using the app for navigation" ></p>

<p>The conditions in which the field work is taking place are fairly extreme. In May the temperature in Abu Dhabi is around 37 degrees celsius, and the habitats we are recording are in wet, tidal locations, often only accessible by beaching the boat at low tide. The soil conditions around mangroves are loose and effectively muddy, and the large seagrass fields can only be validated by boat, either with divers or by using a viewing device over the side of the boat.</p>




<p>The iPad is protected with a waterproof soft case which held up well in the heat, although cloudless skies and dazzling sun meant that glare was a problem.</p>




<p>We identified an area of mangrove that abutted a building site and had been previously mapped using remote sensing. As a test task I set about checking the accuracy of the remote sensing, and whether the extent of the habitat had been reduced at all by the nearby construction work.</p>




<p>The geolocation feature of the application was helpful in navigating to the site, and having the habitat layers made it simple to identify the specific regions of interest.</p>


<p><img class="left" src="/blog/images/field_testing_abu_dhabi/using_the_aplication.png" width="250" title="discussing the work" ></p>

<p>Having found a suitable place to anchor the boat we waded to shore and began the process of validation on foot. Making use of the geolocation feature again, I located myself relative to the mangrove extent and tapped the screen to mark the first point of my validation polygon. I walked a hundred yards and tapped the screen again at my location to create a second point. Using the geolocation marker in this way I worked around the extent of the mangrove until I arrived back at my first position.</p>




<p>Having been around the whole area I was in a good position to then record attributes such as density and size. We encountered some Arabian Deer grazing on the flowering mangrove plans, so I recorded that in the ‘notes’ section and took a few photos which could later be added to the validation via the desktop web interface.</p>


<p><img class="left" src="/blog/images/field_testing_abu_dhabi/island_approach.png" width="250" title="Approaching the mangrove field from the Persian Gulf" ></p>

<p>Two main things to note were that in this instance the remote sensing geometries were very detailed, and due to zoom limitations of the maps we had on the application the validation was only accurate to about 5 meters in a total area size of around 160m2. The second issue appeared when we synchronized the validation with the main application and reviewed it via the web interface. The validation was offset by around 2 meters which was either due to the difference in maps being used or due to the accuracy of the geolocation on the device.</p>




<p>The small size of the validation area amplified the inaccuracies, which on larger areas wouldn’t have the same significance, but we’ll go back and identify why the offset is occurring so we can improve accuracy.</p>




<h2>Conclusions</h2>




<ol>
<li>The glare issue is unsatisfactory and needs to be improved on, probably through modifications to the waterproof case.</li>
<li>The application needs to make use of higher resolution satellite maps to improve the levels of accuracy.</li>
<li>The satellite maps on the mobile application need to be the same as the desktop version (we’d used RapidEye imagery for the mobile app in an attempt to get better detail at higher zoom levels), to ensure consistency.</li>
<li>When validating existing habitats where there is no change it would be beneficial to be able to draw a rough polygon and have it snap to the original data to make sure accuracy isn’t lost. This is particularly valuable where the original data is highly detailed.</li>
<li>A feature to take photos directly in the application and have them attached to the validation would same time and help with cataloging.</li>
</ol>




<p>A really valuable trip, with lessons learned for future development and improvements.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s a good reason to visit Kraków any month of the year*, but this April was particularly abundant in tech events. During the two weeks of my stay there I was able to attend two international conferences and a workshop, all directly relevant to my work at WCMC. So here goes my mission report.</p>

<h2>Stop 1: <a href="http://aceconf.com/">ACE! Agile Central Europe</a></h2>


<p>The theme of this year&#8217;s edition of the Conference on Lean and Agile best practices was Kanban. The theme was tackled from different angles by the speakers, mostly from a high level perspective. A couple of my picks:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://vimeo.com/album/2358750/video/64712079">Dave Snowden - Applying Cynefin to Kanban</a>: everything in this presentation was new and captivating, starting from the inexplicable connection between the spelling and pronunciation of this Welsh word to the theory of complex adaptive systems.</li>

<li><a href="http://vimeo.com/album/2358750/video/64714047">Paweł Brodziński - Portfolio Kanban</a>: visualising work on portfolio level and applying WIP limits helps avoid context switching and improves transparency.</li>

<li><a href="http://vimeo.com/album/2358750/video/64706038">Andrea Provaglio - Dreaming</a>: good process ideas are not reserved to Toyota. I liked the Disney idea rooms and the proposition to keep a good proportion of &#8220;dreambits&#8221; in the project backlog.</li>

<li><a href="http://vimeo.com/album/2358750/video/64714843">Chris McDermott - The Other Side of Kanban</a>: respect for people is a principle which underpins Kanban. Use the innovative capabilities of all people in an organisation.</li>

<li><a href="http://vimeo.com/album/2358750/video/65115852">Matt Philip - Agile QA 2.0</a>: an extremely convincing take on establishing QA in an agile team throughout the development process, as opposed to &#8220;the last column on the Kanban board&#8221;.</li>
</ul>


<p><img class="left" src="/blog/images/report_from_krakow/ace2013_board.jpg" width="250" title="I know about vs I'd like to learn about board" >
<img src="/blog/images/report_from_krakow/ace2013_openspaces.jpg" width="250" title="Timetable of openspace sessions" ></p>

<p>On both days there were open space sessions, where you could choose to join and leave discussions around previously announced topics. Unfortunately, I was disappointed to see many of the open spaces running in Polish. It&#8217;s a shame to exclude many international guests this way. Topics ranged from developer-oriented (&#8220;human factor in code reviews&#8221;) to manager-oriented (&#8220;team motivation in a long running project&#8221;). My favourite was hosted by <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisvmcd">Chris McDermott</a>, where we discussed different aspects of respect in the <a href="http://limitedwipsociety.ning.com/page/lean-coffee">lean coffee</a> format.</p>

<p>And BTW, the &#8220;5 why&#8217;s&#8221; tshirt design sets the bar high for conference swag!</p>

<h2>Stop 2: <a href="http://railsgirls.com/krakow2013">RailsGirls Kraków</a></h2>


<p>RailsGirls is a wildly popular global event, which originated in Finland in 2010. The goal is to encourage women to enter the field of technology in order to bridge the gender gap. The idea is that experienced programmers volunteer to coach beginners and help them build their first web application during a one day workshop.</p>




<p>This was already the second edition of the event in Kraków, first one for me. It was organised by the <a href="http://webmus.es/">Webmuses</a> community and apparently the demand exceeded capacity not only in terms of participants (3 per place) but also coaches. We started with an installation party followed by a clever robot game proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/dira_geek_girl">Irina Dumitrascu</a> - the task was to write a program that guides a robot through a maze. Given that the robots were substituted by coaches and that their task was to execute the program inclusive of signalling error conditions, that had to be a success.</p>




<p>The following day the actual coding started. I coached a group of three very curious and determined women. They asked a lot of good questions and did a brilliant job working on their app. I&#8217;d recommend coaching beginners as a great excercise to anyone who thinks they know anything about whatever - try to explain that to someone who doesn&#8217;t have a clue!</a>

<h2>Stop 3: <a href="http://www.railsberry.com/">Railsberry</a></h2>
<p>The European Rails conference, or conference for curious developers, was the second edition of a spectacular event last year. Think balloons, sun chairs, modern dance performance, extremely well designed and consistent graphics, animations and decorations inside and outside the venue.</p>

<p>The venue! It was a 100-year-old horse tram depot in the historic district of Kazimierz. Old tram rails still leading into the entrance gate (rails, ha! finally I crafted a pun, took me over a year of living in England) and a giant pink unicorn to intimidate passers-by. The best variety swag out there - I scored a pair of <a href="http://unerdwear.com/">nerdies</a> and a Go gopher in addition to the rich contents of my speaker&#8217;s bag, but some people out there were able to collect up to three additional tshirts :)</p>

<p></p>
<p>Getting to the point, the talks were pretty good as well :) My personal favourites:</p>
<ul>
<li>Joseph Wilk Creative Machines - very clever AI machines that draw pictures, compose music and write poetry. An amazingly insightful talk into what we consider creativity and how the role of the unconscious can be better understood through AI.</li>
<li>Andrew Gerrand Go: a simple programming environment - might sound repulsive from a ruby developer, but I&#8217;d really like some data types and pointers at my hands. <a href="https://twitter.com/enneff">Andrew Gerrand</a> highlighted some of the aspects of Go and emphasized its simplicity. And brought a box full of Go gophers :)</li>
<li>Felix Geisendoerfer Programming flying robots with JavaScript - I think it was my original intention to learn programming in order to program a robot, as I could hardly see why else one would go into the trouble. I wish I had pursued that original idea, as it was clearly an early illumination. Programming flying drones seems incomparably more attractive to whatever else you can program.</li>
</ul>

<p>I gave a talk on the first day of the conference about PostgreSQL in context of the database of endangered species, which is one of the biggest projects we&#8217;re working on at the moment at WCMC. I wanted to share my excitement about the advanced features of PostgreSQL that we applied to the taxonomic component of our database, namely recursive CTEs and windowing functions. Speaking in front of this amazing crowd was an ultimate adrenaline rush. I was extremely pleased with the reactions I received and the really good questions people asked afterwards.</p>

<p>On both days of the conference there were lightning talk sessions, which were very rigorously timed by a team armed with a vuvuzela and a speaker-bazooka. Our own CRUG colleague Andrew France made it though!</p>

<p>On the whole, the quality and diversity of Kraków-based events are increasing so rapidly that even as a native I cannot help but be in awe of the potential therein. Well done people!</p>

<p>* Kraków is my home town. I&#8217;m not accepting criticism on that claim.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On the 11th of December 2012 our team prepared a series of Ignite Talks
to show our colleagues at UNEP-WCMC the work that we are doing and how
we go about doing it.</p>

<p>The session started with a talk by our Head of Programme, <a
href="https://coderwall.com/craigmmills">Craig Mills</a>.
He talked about our team and work in 2012.</p>

</p>


<p>Next up was <a href="https://coderwall.com/agnessa">Agnieszka Figiel</a> one
of our Ruby on Rails Developers. Agnieszka explained how we go about
delivering excelence.</p>

<p><a href="https://coderwall.com/simaob">I</a> followed Agnieszka and talked about one of the big projects that we
started in 2012, the Integrated Species Information Platform. A project
that is focused in the redevelopment of the species databases maitained
at UNEP-WCMC, and the creation of new bespoke public facing interfaces
to explore that data.</p>

<p>The last talk of this Ignite Session was done by <a
href="https://coderwall.com/timwilkinson">Tim Wilkinson</a>. Tim talked
about the Abu Dhabi Blue Carbon project, our first iPad App. This
application allows scientist to measure the carbon sequestered by
coastal habitats like mangroves, seagrass, and others. Data can be
collected off-line and then syncronised back into a web server.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It  is a curse of an engineer to be constantly looking for ways of  improving the internal working of things. Since we are a team of  engineers, we quite naturally reached a point when we would like to  introduce improvements to our development process. In agile terms, time  for a retrospective; the first retrospective for this team a couple of  months into a large project.<br />
The  objective of the meeting was to come up with 5 action points, which  could be described as SMART goals. The session was organised as follows:<br />
</p>


<ol>
<li>gathering facts, observations, impressions from the entire span of the project</li>
<li>evaluating those items by voting to come up with a limited set of top issues</li>
<li>get to the root cause of the top issues and come up with the action points</li>
</ol>


<p>Below is a summary of how we worked our way through these phases.</p>


<p><img src="/blog/images/retrospective-board.jpg" alt="Team working at retrospective board"/><br /></p>

<p><strong>Phase  1</strong></p>


<p>In order to aid everyone&#8217;s memory and put our discussions in a  context, we used a timeline drawn on a large board with colour post-its  to represent events. We came up with the following types of events, with  colour coding:</p>


<ul>
<li>Calendar events (green.) These were neutral in character (e.g. &#8220;first  demo&#8221;) and not subject to further discussions. However, they helped to  bring up other events or observations from that time, which would be the  actual items that the team wanted to discuss.</li>
<li>Strong positive or negative events (yellow or pink, respectively.) A  diverse range of items were brought up, such as &#8220;ember.js router&#8221; or  &#8220;real data for development&#8221;. We did not spend too much time on the  wording as long as everyone understood what was meant.</li>
<li>Ambivalent events (yellow/pink.) To give an example, we discussed the  impact that a new team member joining the team had on the project. The  team recalled this as a very positive event, because this happened at a  time when the workload exceeded the existing capacity. However, the new  team member themselves had an unpleasant recollection of joining a  project where a lot of conceptual work has been already done, and it  wasn&#8217;t particularly easy for them to jump right into the project.</li>
<li>Items present throughout the span of the project. Some events would not  easily fit in our timeline, e.g. &#8220;daily stand-ups&#8221;. The team came up  with the idea to place them above the timeline board.</li>
</ul>


<p>This  phase was abundant in discussions, which made us aware of different  points of view. That, in turn, was a good base for the next phase of the  meeting.</p>


<p><strong>Phase  2</strong></p>


<p>At some point we were happy with the set of events represented on  our timeline and we started the voting phase. Since everyone likes  stickers, we used red and green ones to vote on items which were the  most problematic and most successful, respectively. Everyone would get 5  red and 5 green votes. On reflection I&#8217;m not sure if this was the right  thing to do, because initially there was confusion as to how we  understand the colour coding. It seems that it is easier for the team to  focus either on the positive or the negative aspects rather than  evaluate across the entire spectrum during the voting phase. In the end  everyone seemed to be more focused on the issues, so I guess while  flagging positive aspects is definitely a good thing, voting for them  introduced some noise.</p>


<p><strong>Phase  3</strong></p></p>

<p>Once we had our highest voted issues identified, we went one by one  to get to the root cause. We tried to apply the <a title="5-why analysis" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys" target="_blank">5-why</a> method for that,  but it turned out to be cumbersome to use. In fact, because the highest  voted items were covered very well during Phase 1, in many cases the  root cause and solutions were already clear. Therefore, we were able to  come up with a sound set of action points.</p>


<table style="vertical-align: top;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="padding: 0 15px 0 0;">
<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>
There  were a couple of challenges with this retrospective. Firstly, the  facilitator was a member of the team, which meant they had to try to do  two things at a time, which never works. Fortunately, one of the  outcomes of this meeting is that we will have a much better facilitator  in the future. Another problem was the long time span of the project to  discuss, which made a lot of interesting smaller points disappear when  confronted with much more heavy weight items. That, however, is likely  to become more balanced as we get into the routine of regular  retrospectives. To sum up, it was a rather successful meeting, well done  everyone!</td>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We&#8217;ve been playing with <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a> with <a href="http://nowjs.com/">now.js</a> this week to put together a collaborative browser based polygon editor we&#8217;re calling <strong>&#8216;Polybri&#8217;</strong></p>


<p><img src="/blog/images/polybri.png" alt="Polybri screenshot"/></p>


<p>The app syncs a polygon between users as they edit them in real time. <a href="http://nowjs.com/">Now.js</a> is used to pass chat messages and GeoJSON between clients.</p>


<p>When user are finished editing, they can save their maps, which are then displayed with <a href="http://polymaps.org/">Polymaps</a> on the homepage</p>


<p>You can check out the code over at our <a href="https://github.com/unepwcmc/polybri">Github Repo</a></p>
