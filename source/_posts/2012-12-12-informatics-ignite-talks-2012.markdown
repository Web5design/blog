On the 11th of December 2012 our team prepared a series of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignite_(event)">Ignite Talks</a>
to show our colleagues at UNEP-WCMC the work that we are doing and how
we go about doing it.

The session started with a talk by our Head of Programme, <a
href="https://coderwall.com/craigmmills">Craig Mills</a>.
He talked about our team and work in 2012.

<a href="https://coderwall.com/simaob">I</a> followed Agnieszka and talked about one of the big projects that we
started in 2012, the Integrated Species Information Platform. A project
that is focused in the redevelopment of the species databases maitained
at UNEP-WCMC, and the creation of new bespoke public facing interfaces
to explore that data.

<a href="https://coderwall.com/th3james">James Cox</a> talked about the <a

This web application was developed in BackboneJS in early 2012 and is a way
for Governments to decide where to invest their money to protect great
apes.

<a href="https://coderwall.com/decioferreira">Décio Ferreira</a> talked 
about the <a href="http://reddplusdatabase.org/">Voluntary REDD+ Database</a>.
A tool to provide information to the global community on <a

financing, actions and results, providing the ability to search,
summarise and visualize data. (Unfortunately his talk is not yet

The last talk of this Ignite Session was done by <a
href="https://coderwall.com/timwilkinson">Tim Wilkinson</a>. Tim talked
about the Abu Dhabi Blue Carbon project, our first iPad App. This
application allows scientist to measure the carbon sequestered by
coastal habitats like mangroves, seagrass, and others. Data can be
collected off-line and then syncronised back into a web server.

After Tim's talk Craig Mills has closed the session with a quick glimpse
into the year of 2013.

<strong>Ignite Talks:</strong> each of our talks lasted for 5 minutes
  and consisted of 20 slides that transitioned automatically after 15
seconds.
