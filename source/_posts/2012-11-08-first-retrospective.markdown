<p>It  is a curse of an engineer to be constantly looking for ways of  improving the internal working of things. Since we are a team of  engineers, we quite naturally reached a point when we would like to  introduce improvements to our development process. In agile terms, time  for a retrospective; the first retrospective for this team a couple of  months into a large project.<br />
The  objective of the meeting was to come up with 5 action points, which  could be described as SMART goals. The session was organised as follows:<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>gathering facts, observations, impressions from the entire span of the project</li>
<li>evaluating those items by voting to come up with a limited set of top issues</li>
<li>get to the root cause of the top issues and come up with the action points</li>
</ol>
<p>Below is a summary of how we worked our way through these phases.</p>

<p><strong>Phase  1</strong></p>
<p>In order to aid everyone's memory and put our discussions in a  context, we used a timeline drawn on a large board with colour post-its  to represent events. We came up with the following types of events, with  colour coding:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calendar events (green.) These were neutral in character (e.g. "first  demo") and not subject to further discussions. However, they helped to  bring up other events or observations from that time, which would be the  actual items that the team wanted to discuss.</li>
<li>Strong positive or negative events (yellow or pink, respectively.) A  diverse range of items were brought up, such as "ember.js router" or  "real data for development". We did not spend too much time on the  wording as long as everyone understood what was meant.</li>
<li>Ambivalent events (yellow/pink.) To give an example, we discussed the  impact that a new team member joining the team had on the project. The  team recalled this as a very positive event, because this happened at a  time when the workload exceeded the existing capacity. However, the new  team member themselves had an unpleasant recollection of joining a  project where a lot of conceptual work has been already done, and it  wasn't particularly easy for them to jump right into the project.</li>
<li>Items present throughout the span of the project. Some events would not  easily fit in our timeline, e.g. "daily stand-ups". The team came up  with the idea to place them above the timeline board.</li>
</ul>
<p>This  phase was abundant in discussions, which made us aware of different  points of view. That, in turn, was a good base for the next phase of the  meeting.</p>
<p><strong>Phase  2</strong></p>
<p>At some point we were happy with the set of events represented on  our timeline and we started the voting phase. Since everyone likes  stickers, we used red and green ones to vote on items which were the  most problematic and most successful, respectively. Everyone would get 5  red and 5 green votes. On reflection I'm not sure if this was the right  thing to do, because initially there was confusion as to how we  understand the colour coding. It seems that it is easier for the team to  focus either on the positive or the negative aspects rather than  evaluate across the entire spectrum during the voting phase. In the end  everyone seemed to be more focused on the issues, so I guess while  flagging positive aspects is definitely a good thing, voting for them  introduced some noise.</p>

<strong>Phase  3</strong></p>
<p>Once we had our highest voted issues identified, we went one by one  to get to the root cause. We tried to apply the <a title="5-why analysis" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys" target="_blank">5-why</a> method for that,  but it turned out to be cumbersome to use. In fact, because the highest  voted items were covered very well during Phase 1, in many cases the  root cause and solutions were already clear. Therefore, we were able to  come up with a sound set of action points.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>
There  were a couple of challenges with this retrospective. Firstly, the  facilitator was a member of the team, which meant they had to try to do  two things at a time, which never works. Fortunately, one of the  outcomes of this meeting is that we will have a much better facilitator  in the future. Another problem was the long time span of the project to  discuss, which made a lot of interesting smaller points disappear when  confronted with much more heavy weight items. That, however, is likely  to become more balanced as we get into the routine of regular  retrospectives. To sum up, it was a rather successful meeting, well done  everyone!</td>
