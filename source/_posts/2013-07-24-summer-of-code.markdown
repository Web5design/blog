This summer at WCMC we are privileged to be working with two teams of amazing ladies. They are sharpening their programming skills while helping open source projects as part of their <a href="http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/">RG Summer of Code internships</a>. Meet our teams!

<strong>Team Species+:</strong> Wiktoria Dalach and Alicja Cyganiewicz are making their way through the perplexities of taxonomy. They are all set to make species information understandable through smart visualisations powered by the upcoming Species+ API. <a href="http://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/teams/7">Team page</a>

<strong>Team ProtectedPlanet:</strong> Patricia Cuppu and Paola Moreno are a volunteer RG SoC team of astonishing spirit and perseverance. They are working on integrating data from the <a href="http://www.protectedplanet.net/">ProtectedPlanet</a> API into a tourism site revolving around exploring protected areas.
</p>

<p>
We wanted to discover what drives them and how they are finding their Summer of Code so far. Quite interestingly, it turns out <strong>C/C++</strong> still has a lot of appeal for brilliant young minds and that the world of software is one of <strong>enjoyable suffering</strong>. This is what they've told us:
</p>

<h2>What is the single most amusing / unexpected / crazy thing you learned in the last three weeks?</h2>

<p>
<strong>Patricia:</strong>
Building up fast web applications using Ruby on Rails, updating databases and retrieving some information. Learn how URL works to manage the control of API's
</p>
<p>
<strong>Paola:</strong>
You don’t only learn ruby and rails (which are powerful by themselves), you learn a style of programming called excellent practices instead of good practices. You become able to develop in team, produce good blocks of code, take account of the time and minimize the times you could screw up!
</p>
<p>
<strong>Wiktoria:</strong>
I learned that I can solve some problems just by reading error messages :D
</p>
<p>
<strong>Alicja:</strong>
That I don't have to reinvent the wheel, the Internet ;) There are so many frameworks, gems, libraries... It was a little bit frightening (oh my God, I know next to nothing about being a software developer!), really amazing, though. It's like santa's sack - bottomless, infinite.

<h2>What is the best thing about being a software developer?</h2>
<p>
<strong>Patricia:</strong>
Designing solutions to solve software problems. Working in a group, coming up with new ideas.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Paola:</strong>
That you can do anything! Being a programmer is like having a magic wand. With software you can venture into any field, turn any idea into something tangible, help to speed up many processes, etc. And on a personal level, it gives you an interesting twist hahaha!
</p>
<p>
<strong>Wiktoria:</strong>
The best thing about being a software dev is a possibility to create something from almost nothing. Something that can be pretty, useful for others and can help them.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Alicja:</strong>
It's creating stuff. Making things "happen". Facing the challenges. That feeling when you can stay awake for the whole night, focused on a goal.

<h2>How did you first become interested in programming?</h2>
<p>
<strong>Patricia:</strong>
When I was at university, I learnt to program in C.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Paola:</strong>
I had a great teacher who simply taught me to admire, learn programming, and also to survive on the way!
</p>
<p>
<strong>Wiktoria:</strong>
Well.. :) Long story short. I've never been interested in programming, but all of a sudden I've discovered, that it can be fun and influential. I took part in the first Polish Rails Girls edition in 2012 and 12 months later I was a RG coach for the first time.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Alicja:</strong>
Being deeply in love with Math I chose Mathematics and Information Technologies at High School. We were learning C++. And I could stay in the classroom for ever. Making things "happen" was an extremely amazing feeling.
</p>

<h2>Best piece of advice you were given so far in your coding career?</h2>
<p>
<strong>Patricia:</strong>
Before implementing code, make drawings (schemes, models, window interfaces...) to have a clearer idea of what is aimed to be developed. Making the coding organized, and work using modularity when possible to facilitate maintenance and reuse of code.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Paola:</strong>
Reuse, do it functional and understandable for users, and when something doesn’t work, have a break with a coffee (or beer), relax and then sit down to see if you found the solution!
</p>
<p>
<strong>Wiktoria:</strong>
Think about programming language as just another foreign language to learn. Accept the rules and keep writing and reading. We don't expect German not to have "der die das" or English to be written as pronounced, right? So it should be with a programming language - you learn it just to tell a different kind of a story :)
</p>
<p>
<strong>Alicja:</strong>
There are no stupid questions - my friend who works with me says it every single day. So feel free to ask, to look for. Google is not going to make fun of you.
</p>

<h2>What would you say to other women interested in getting into software development?</h2>
<p>
<strong>Patricia:</strong>
Start learning the basics of any programming language and then choose a programming language to learn more, regarding what application you would like to work on. And even if it is a bit hard at the beginning, later on it will make you feel happy with yourself since you get results of your work that really encourage to learn more about software developement.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Paola:</strong>
Do not think twice! This is a fascinating world where people suffer, but enjoy! ;)
</p>
<p>
<strong>Wiktoria:</strong>
Go for it! There is nothing to be worried about.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Alicja:</strong>
If I can do it - you can do it as well. Your sex has no connection with dev-stuff. Sorry, wrong. There is a connection. We can be better, but shhhh... ;)
</p>
