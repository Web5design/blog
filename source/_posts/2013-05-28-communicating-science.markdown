<h2>How can scientists make their complicated domain relevant to policy? </h2>

This was the main issue discussed as my recent visit to Oxford University for a scientific data visualisation workshop.

It was a day of short presentations from researchers in the field of <a href='http://www.itrc.org.uk/'>modelling the future of national infrastructure</a> followed by insights from people in the field of data visualisations.  I shared the experiences of UNEP-WCMC in striving to produce visualisations on the web that have real influence and genuinely impact "decision makers".  

My presentation focussed on three main points:

<li>So obvious but so often ignored.  To be able to communicate science to policy makers it needs to solve a genuine problem of a user, e.g. how do we make it easier for a senior civil servant to understand the value of biodiversity, how can an environmental minister have information that gives them power when debating with the finance minister, how can civil society be empowered to apply pressure to their governments?  Scientific discovery often isn't a response to an immediate political problem so aligning the discovery with a policy demand can be difficult.</li>

<li>The process of designing visualisations can follow a bunch of important principles which help everything from usability to the aesthetics of a clear message.  A clear message that fulfils the objectives of a user.  However, when we create something it's subject to all the assumptions and bias of any human bean, therefore it's critical to test our principles for success.  The Internet is a great playground for testing and improvement so I talked a little about how we are doing usability and A/B testing to inform whether we are any good or not.</li>

<li>I couldn't help but talk about some of the software we use to do our jobs, why SQL is so good, and Ruby is a great language for tooling around with data and making websites.  I also introduced some of the open source software we are developing to convert complex analytic science into simple mapping exploration interfaces.</li>

Here is the presentation I gave:

<h3>Some overall reflections.</h3>

<p>It struck me that the data visualisation movement can appear to be more art than science, it's why scientists are struggling with it.  I think there is scope to be more scientific and optimise our design based on empirical data however I also think we need to encourage art back into the science domain where usability and information design are the obvious cross-over.  I'm excited to see this cross over already happening.</p>

<p>A great conversation emerged with Greg McInerny (one such cross-over scientist:  <a href='https://twitter.com/GregMcI'>@GregMcI</a>) where we explored the idea of scaling up usability tests on data visualisations, harnessing communities such as those in the Oxford Astrophysics lab Galaxy Zoo project.  The idea would be to see if we can optimise the impact of visualisations by adjusting one parameter at a time and asking questions to users about the information (e.g. gradually increase saturation of colour or location of title or legend font or increase number of parameters displayed).  If this process could be automated, one could in theory feed in a visualisation on day 1 and on day 4 we would have an altered visualisation optimised to deliver the greatest impact.  An embryo of an idea with many many things to consider but if nothing else it would be great to test the principles of design we hold so dear.</p>

Well worth the 4am start, my head hurts from talking with so many smart people.  My resolve to try and figure out how to improve the impact of environmental science in the policy world has been strengthened.
